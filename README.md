#Bullet Heck
Bullet Heck is a game in the "Bullet Hell" genre. It is my first real project in pygame.
- Each level increases the difficulty by adding more enemies and increasing their speed.
- The enemies' color is more blue if they are slower, and more red if they are faster.
- To move on to the next level, survive the current level for 20 seconds.
- The game checkpoints every 5 levels. You do not need to win the level for it to check point.
	* For example, if you reach level 5, but die on your first try, it will start you back on level 5.
- There are endless levels at the moment. Bosses, etc planned and maybe a real ending, too.

**Controls:**
* WASD keys or arrow keys for movement
* Mouse to shoot. Left click for quick single shots, right for slow burst shots
* The larger squares are powerups

**TODO:**
- Balanced change in levels
- Save
- Confirm on quit
- Options Menu
    * Variable window size
    * Color preferences(?)

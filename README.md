#Bullet Heck
Bullet Heck is a game in the "Bullet Hell" genre. It is my first real project in pygame.
Each level increases the difficulty by adding more enemies and increasing their speed.

**Controls:**
* WASD keys or arrow keys for movement.
* Mouse to shoot

**Future Goals:**
- [ ] Balanced change in levels
- [ ] Save
- [ ] Options Menu
    * [ ] Variable window size
    * [ ] Color preferences
